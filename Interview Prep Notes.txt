	CORE JAVA
------------------------------
*java is platform independent . Because Java compiler converts High Level Language to Byte code this byte code is independent of any platform. If JVM is present we can run Java code in any platform , this feature is also called as WORA.

String
==============================
*Strings in Java are treated as Object and memory will be allocated in Heap Area.
*String is a set of characters which is enclosed with double quotes ""
*In Heap Area there is a special region called "String Constant Pool" where duplicates are not allowed whereas in Heap area ,duplicates are allowed. 


Immutable String-
-make use of String class
-Once Created can not be changed
-1.String s = "Ravish";
	*Memory will be allocated in String Constant Pool when created without new keyword
 2.String s = new String("Ravish");
	**Memory will be allocated in Heap area when created with new keyword also one copy will be created in SCP
-When we use String referances to call the methods of String class, new String will be created and that too in heap area. the base string will be not be modified as it is a Immutable string
-If we use "+" without any referances to concatinate 2 strings then memory will be allocated in SCP , If we use + sign to concatinate using references then memory will be allocated in Heap area.
*Different ways to compare Strings
 -== - referance variables will be compared
 -equals - actual string values will be compared
 -equalsIgnoreCase() - actual string values are compared with ignoring the case
 -compareTo()- values of string are compared lexicographically(Character by Character)


Mutable String
-make use of StringBuffer and StringBuilder class
-Once created can be replaced or updated the value
-when we use append method to change the String object value, same memory will be modified.
-when we use equals method to compare 2 strings in Mutable Strings , it will call from Object class which compares referance not data. so if 2 strings are equals also it will return false.
-Default capacity for StringBuffer is 16 and if its filled new capacity will be (current capacity+1)*2
-Also we can specify capacity in constructor while creating object
	StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(19);- capacity =19
	StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Ravish"); - capacity = 16+6=22
-String Builder is not thread safe, not sychronized , many threads can operate, 1.5V, high performance
-String Buffer is thread safe, synchronized, only one thread can operate, 1.0V, low performace




Array
=============================
-Collection of homogeneous elements in contigueos memory.
-Jagged array is a multidimensional array where member arrays are different in length.



Encapsulation
=============================
*Enacpsulation is a method of hiding the sensitive data from user by making fields as private.
*We create getters and setters which are public methods the access the fields which helps to get the value and set the value respectively.
*getters are read only methods and setters are write only methods.

Inheritance
=============================
*process of class deriving from another class using extends keyword called Inheritance.
*All the fields and behaviours from the Super class get inherited to sub class.
*After Creating an object from Parent referance with Child constructor, we can only access inherited/overridden method and can not access speciliazed methods which are only in child class. But specialized methods can be accessed by changing the parent class Cast to downcasting.


Method Overriding and Method Overloading
--------------------------------------------
*Method overloading is a process of packing the class with same method with different types of parameters.
*Method overriding is a process of re writing the method definition/implementation from the super class , in a sub class.
	-Rules to override a method
	*We can not reduce the visibility while overriding a method
	*We can increase the visibility while overriding.
	*return type of overridden method must be same
	*Can be different iff it co-variant return type(Where return types have is-a relationship)
	*parameter list also must be same

Polymorphism
=========================================
*It is a feature of where one thing behave as many forms.
*static method particpate in Inheritence but can not be overridden. This is called method hiding.
*Method Overriding is a Runtime polymorphism and method overloading is a compile time polymorphism.
*child class object can have parent type reference , where parent beahves as child.
*Parent Child relationship is called is-A relationship
* Differenace between IS-A relationship and HAS-A relationship
-IS-A - 1.It is able to define inheritence b/w 2 classes
	2.It also promotes code reusabilities.
-HAS-A- 1.It will define associations b/w 2 entities in java app
	2.Improve communication between 2 entities.

* Associations in java- 1. 1 to 1 2.1 to many 3. many to 1 4. many to many.
- Student has a Address (Student is a Target class and Address is a Dependant object- 1:1)
-Student has  Addresses(1:M)
-Branch has Employees(M:1)
-Students has Courses(M:M)

*Composition and Aggregation
-Aggregation - In case of agg, if the contained object would be existed even without container object. Ex. Relationship b/w Library and Student.
-Composition - In case of composition, if the contained object does not existed then container object also wont exist. Ex Relationship b/w Library and Books

Abstraction
==========================
*abstract keyword can be used with classes and methods
*If a class is made abstarct the object of that class can not be created(but referance can be created) , One must inherit the class to access it.
*If a method is made abstract, then the method does not have any body.  also abstract methods can only be specified in abstract classes.
*Abstract class can have both abstract methods and concrete methods.
*The class which inherits the abstract class must give body to abstract method of the parent class or it should also be declared as abstract.


Interface
=========================
*100 % of abstraction can be achieved.- contains only pure abstract methods
*Interface contains only method signature not implementations. The class which inherits the interface must give the implementation or should declare itself as abstract class.
*By default all methods in Interface are "public & abstract". and we can not change the access modifier from public.
*A class can implement any number of interface but can extend only one class.
*When an interface wants to inherit other interface it uses extends keyword.
*Interface can have variable, However that variable must be "public static final"
*From java8 Interface can have method with body!!!! and we should use "default" keyword to specify body to a method. We can also use this method in inheritance
*From java8 Interface can also have static methods.!!! static methods do not takes place in inheritance
*From java9 Interface can have private methods. Can not be part of inheritance

*Functional Interface
-Interface which has only one method is called Functional Interface
*Marker Interface/Tagged Interface
-Interface which does not have any method or which is empty



Objects&Classes
==============================
Objects
--------
*Object class is the parent class of all classes in Java
*equals() method in the Object class compares refrances not the values.
*toString method in Object class convert the Object into string



Keywords in Java
=======================
final
------
*Final can be applied to field level, method level, class level
* If final is applied to filed level, variable value can not be changed, if we try so it would result in compile time error
	For Primitive datatypes values can not be changed and for non primitive ,referances can not be changed.
* If final is applied to method level, we cannot override that method
* If final is applied to Class level, we can not Inherit that class.

static
-------
*static can be applied to variable, method, block
*static variables can be accessed anywhere 
*non static variables can not be access inside static method and static block
*when we apply static to variable/method/block that becomes common /shared by all instances of the class.
*static entity always loads when the class loads.in following order
	static variable- Heap area from Java8
	static block
	static method
*When an entity is static no need to create the object of the class to call it. We can directly call it using class name



Exception Handling
=================================
-Abnormal termination of application in run time is called exception. Its different from Runtime error which occurs due to logical error.
-There are 2 types of Exception- Checked Exception, Unchecked Exception.
-Which ever the method creates exception, it will create the object of Exception and give it to JVM and JVM gives to Default Exception handler if we not handled the exception.
-We use try and catch block to handle exception. We write the main code inside try and handle in catch block, whenever exception occur lines after the exception in try block will not be executed , insted catch block gets executed.lines below catch also will be executed.
-We can have multiple catch blocks for single try block
-If a method is giving an exception JVM will check for the method, all method who are calling it and if no method handled it, JVM will give the exception object to Default exception handler.
-When Exception generated we can do 3 things- 1. Handle the exception(try-catch) 2.Duck the Exception(throws)  3. Re throw an exception(try,catch,throw,throws,finally)
-Exception may be compile time exception or runtime exception. In CTE compiler will force u to handle the exception. This is also called Checked Exception. Runtime exceptions are called Unchecked exceptions.
-After handling the exception again throwing the exception to the callers is called re-throwing an exception.We use "throw" keyword to rethrow the exception. and to duck the exception we use throws keyword. throws keyword is used in method signature. whereas throw keyword is used in catch block to rethrow the exception object.After rethrowing the exception we should use throws keyword in method signature.
-When we use throw keyword to rethrow the exception, statements after the throw keyword will not be executed. In this case we use finally block to execute the critical stement irrespective of exceptions handled or throwed does not matter, finally block will be executed.
- finally block will always dominate return statement. If we want to execute anything after return statement we can use finally block.
-only try we cannot write, either catch or finally must be there.
-only finally/catch block can not be used alone, we must use try block
-System.exit(0) will dominate the finally block, finally block will not be executed if the method is present.
-we can write throws keyword in method/constructor signature but not in class signature.
-Overridden methods can throw only unchecked exception if parent class method does not throws any exception or if parent method has unchecked exception.

-We can create our own exception called custom exception. Extending  Exception class, we can create our own exception.
-We can close the resources in finally block or Resources which we are using are Implementing AutoClosable interface then those resources will close automatically.
-resources used in try with resources are made final . can not alter.
-only try block can be written iff, if try with resource is written.



Multithreading
==================================
- Single threaded programs will waste the CPU time cycle so we go to the concept of multithreading.
-We can create Threads using 2 ways
	* Extending Thread class
	*Implementing Runnable interface- functional interface having run() method
-Thread class implements Runnable Interface

 *****Extending Thread class*****
-we have to mention all tasks inside run() method for a thread.
-to run the run() method of any thread, we can call start() method of Thread class.
-as a developer we should not call the run method if we are extending Thread class. We should always call start method which internally calls run method.
-Thread Scheduler will decide the flow of excecution of all the threads.which thread will get the chance always Thread scheduler decides. we can not decide.
-TS will make sure that CPU time cycle is not wasted.
-start() method will give life to a Thread also it will give the thread to TS

 *****Implementing Runnable interface****
*When we create a thread using Runnable interface, Create a object of Thread class and then pass the object of thread which we created using Runnable interface inside the the object of thread which created using Thread class.
eg-
	Class Demo implements Runnable{
		run(){
		}
	}
	Class Main{
		psvm(Str arg[]){
			Demo d = new Demo(); 
			Thread t1 = new Thread(d);
			t1.start();
		}
	}

-Among these 2 methods,implementing Runnable is better because, If a class extends Thread class then it can not extend any other class.
-If we call run method instead of start method, program will behave like a single threaded program. because run method can not give control to TS.
-we can give name to thread by using setName() method. t1.setName("thread1");
-isAlive() method- it is used to check if the thread is alive or not, this method will return boolean value
-join() method - it is used to make a thread wait for another thread. for ex. if main thread is running and if we say t1.join() where t1 is a object of Thread, then main method will wait until the t1 thread completes.
-we can set priority to a thread using setPriority() method. Higher the number higher the priority.
-Race condition - Its a phenomenon in multithreading in Java where multiple threads will race towards CPU time life cycle to complete its work without caring other threads. To overcome we have the concept of Syncronization.
-To achieve syncronization we use synchronized key word at block/method level. Whenever we apply synchronized to a method or block only one Thread can use it at a time. thus Race condition problem is resolved.
-synchronized methods are slower but thread safe.
-If we use non synchronized method to use by many Threads that leads to data inconsistency. So we arrive at synchronized method.
-synchronized with static method is class level lock and synchronized with non-static methd is a object level lock
- States of Thread -> New - Runnable - Running - Dead
	* while in Running state it can go to sleep state(when sleep method is called), block state(when required resources are not avialable) and wait state(when wait method is called)
	*thread will come to Runnable again comes out of sleep(when sleep time is over), block state(when required resource is avialble) and wait(when notify(),notigyAll() methods are called.
	*From Runnable state thread can go to dead state when intrrupt method is called.

-When multiple threads are strucked in the block state due to mutual dependency of resources.This scenario we call it is dead lock.
-We can create ThreadGroup to perform a same action on many threads.
-There is concept of Daemon thread, which means which is not important thread, By default in Java, all threads created are Non-Daemon threads, However we can change it, but we can not make main thread as Daemon thread. 


======================================
Var Args- Variable length arguments
=======================================
*If we want to pass multiple data of same types in a method we can use VarArgs using ...
ex- public int add(int ... nums){
		--logic for array nums to add numbers--
	}
when calling the above method we can directly pass multiple interger type data like, add(3,4,5,6,7,8);
Internally these numbers will be converted into array. 	



Nested Class
======================================
-Class inside a class is called Nested  class.
-Nested class is divided into 2 types
-1.Static nested class 2. Inner class



Anonymous Inner Class
================================
-It is a class without a name
-Can be applied to any interface or any abstract class/concrete class also
-We give the implementation for a class method/s while createing the object of that class/interface



Lambda Expression
================================
-Used to give implementation to functional interface
ex- Runnable r = ()-> System.out.println("Running");
the above example will override the run method of Runnable interface which is functional interface

-If the method in function interface accepts any parameter we can write lambda like below-
ex- assume run class accepting some parameter integer i then,
	Runnable r = i->syso("value is"+i);



Access Modifiers
================================
*Public-participate in Inheritance, Can be accessed from anywhere
*Protected-participate in Inheritance,Can not be accessed outside the package without relationship otherwise can be accessd anywhere.
*Default-participate in Inheritance, Can not be accessed outside package.
*Private- Do not participate in Inheritance, can not be accessed outside the class



Wrapper Classes
Collections
Enum
=============

Annotations
==============


Producer & Consumer Problem
Stream API


File Handling
=========================
File- 
*when we create a object of File , physical file will not be created. it just refers to a file
*To create that file, we should call createFile() method. ---> File f = new File("abc.txt"); f.createFile();
*To Create directory we use mkdir() method
*Constructors- File(String s), File(String,String), File(File,String)
*Eg- File f1 = new File("IplTeams"); f1.mkdir(); File f2 = new File(f,rcb.txt); f2.createFile();
*we can use list() method to list all files in a directory
*exists(),isFile(),isDirectory() are methods to verify.



FileWriter
FileReader
BufferedWriter
BufferedReader



FileWriter- when we create a object directly creates file to write. If the file exists it will reuse the same file and override the content.
*If override is the content is not equal use Constructor FileWriter("info.txt",false)
*Constructors- FileWriter(File),FileWriter(String),FileWriter(String,Boolean)
*write(),flush(),close() are 3 important methods.
*Drawback of FileWriter is we need to manually write \n to go to new line which may change from system to system. 















-----------------------------------------
JDBC
-----------------------------------------
* 6 Steps to Connect Database to Java Application
1.Load and Register the driver- From jdbc4 this step is not required.
	Driver driver = new Driver();
	DriverManager.registerDriver(driver);

url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname"
2.Establish a connection between Java Application and Database
	Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url,user,pw);

3.Create the statement object/ PreparedStatement Object
	Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
			or
	PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sqlQuery);
	

4.Process and execute the query
	statement.executeQuery/statement.executeUpdate(sqlQuery);
				or
	pstmt.executeQuery();
5.Process the Result from ResultSet.
6.Close the connection
	connection.close();


select query - executeQuery();
non select - executeUpdate();
execute() - for both

SQL Injection
==========================

-- -> this is the symbol to comment out sql single line.
so we use prepared statement to pass the input at runtime.


java.util.Date - Wed Jul 31 21:32:20 IST 2024
java.sql.Date - 2024-07-31

User(String) -java.text.SimpleDateFormat - java.util.Date - java.sql.Date - pstmt.setDate() - DB


BLOB- Binary Large Object
CLOB- Character Large Object
Connection Pooling
======================
-Creationg and destruction of connection object is difficult.
-so javax.sql.DataSource interface gives connection pool interface. DB vendors give implemention to this. When user wants to talk to DB he will use this connection pool objects.
-When we use connection.close in normal way connection will be closed. But in connection pooling if close the connection, that connection go back and sit in connection pooling.



Transaction
java.sql.RowSet








Servlets
===================
-There is no main method while writing servlets because, its a web application single threaded programs are not good. So in server , server maintains something called as Thread pool, when user requests it will provide one thread.

Servlet(I)- init(),service,deinstantiation(),getServletInfo(),getServletConfig()

GenericServlet(AC)- only service method is abstract
HttpServlet(AC)- extends GenricServlet
-HttpServletRequest(I)
-HttpServletResponse(I)
-HttpSession(I)
-HttpServlet(C)
-Cookie(C)

HTTP Protocol Request-
-----------------------------
*Request Line- HTTP Method(GET/POST...) -Requested Resource(/test) - protocol version(HTTP/1.1)
*Request Headers- Browser details and its language format and so on...
*Request Body- Contains user information.(User supplied info)

HTTP Protocol Response -
----------------------------
*Status Line- Protocol Version(HTTP/1.1/) -- status code(200)-Description of code(OK)
	1XX - Informational
	2XX - Successful
	3XX - Redirection
	4XX - Client Error
	5XX - Server Error
*Response Headers- MIME(Multipurpose Internet Mail Exchange)- Content type, content length, modified date etc..
*Response Body- Actual Information which will be displayed to the user.

Types of HttpRequest Methods
--------------------------------
GET - Get Information from server/ Can be bookmarked / request data is visible in address bar so not secured / Query String is sent is Request Line/ Request Body is empty./ It is Idempotent
POST- Send information to server/ Can not be bookmarked / request data is not visible so its secured. / Query String is sent in Request Body/ Its is non Idempotent

PUT- Update Information in server
DELETE
HEAD
OPTIONS
TRACE

-HttpServlet Class does not contain any abstract method but still it is made as abstract because, one should not create the object directly from HttpServlet class, only object should be created from the class which extends HttpServlet.
